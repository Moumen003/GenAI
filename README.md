Image Captioning, Translation, and Speech Generation Project

Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered pipeline that performs three tasks:
	1.	Image Captioning: Automatically generates a descriptive caption for an image.
	2.	Translation: Translates the generated caption into a target language.
	3.	Speech Generation: Converts the translated text into speech audio.

The end result is a spoken translation of the description of an image.

Project Workflow

	1.	Input: Provide an image.
	2.	Image Captioning: Generate a natural language caption for the image.
	3.	Translation: Translate the caption into the desired language.
	4.	Text-to-Speech (TTS): Convert the translated caption into audio.
	5.	Output: Audio file or playback of the spoken translation.

Technologies Used

	•	Image Captioning:
	•	Framework: PyTorch, TensorFlow
	•	Pre-trained Models: CNN-LSTM, or Vision Transformers like CLIP.
	•	Translation:
	•	Framework: Hugging Face Transformers
	•	Pre-trained Models: Helsinki-NLP (MarianMT), Google Translate API
	•	Text-to-Speech:
	•	Framework: Coqui TTS, pyttsx3
	•	Pre-trained Models: Tacotron, WaveNet
	•	Other Libraries:
	•	OpenCV: For image preprocessing
	•	Flask/Django: For building a user interface (optional)



Install Additional Models

	•	Download pre-trained weights for image captioning and place them in the models folder.
	•	Optionally, install translation and TTS models using Hugging Face or Coqui CLI.

Usage

1. Run the Pipeline

Use the command line to run the project:

python main.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg --target_language es

	•	Replace path/to/image.jpg with the path to your input image.
	•	Replace es with the ISO code for the target language (e.g., fr for French, de for German).

2. Output

	•	The generated caption, translation, and audio file are saved in the output/ folder.
	•	The audio is also played back automatically (if enabled).

Features

	•	Supports multiple languages for translation.
	•	Real-time audio playback of the translated caption.
	•	Modular design for easy extension.

Future Improvements

	•	Add support for additional languages.
	•	Enhance the UI with a web interface using Flask or Django.
	•	Optimize performance for real-time use cases.
